I'm now a PhD student from School of Economics, Zhejiang University. My research interest includes a range of macroeconomic questions related to monetary policy, fiscal policy, and rational inattention. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jieran Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/jieranwu/).
